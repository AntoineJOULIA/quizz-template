This is a template to create quiz, developed with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Quizz questions

Each quiz question page displays a "hard hint" picture challenging the user to identify the answer. It is possible to toggle an "easy hint" picture.

A third kind of hint is related to the title/name of the answer, displaying the first letter, the other ones replaced by "\_" characters.

## Achievements
